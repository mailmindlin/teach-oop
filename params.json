{"name":"Teach-oop","tagline":"A website designed to teach the concept(s) of object oriented programing through a semi-intuitive interface.","body":"### Welcome to Teach-OOP.\r\nThis is a project that I am working on during my free time. There are many tools (i.e., [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) and [Alice](http://www.alice.org/index.php)), but while they teach students to think logically, they don't help people learn skills that are 'portable' to real-life programming in languages such as JavaScript and Python.\r\n\r\n### Why use Teach-OOP?\r\nAs stated above, students are taught some skills in school, but the more commonly used programs have a limited usability in real life. Teach-OOP provides an intuitive D&D interface that can be used to produce the most basic `hello world` to a complicated object-oriented object recognition program.\r\n\r\n### Technical Stuff\r\nTeach-OOP converts every project to JavaScript, which is optimized using the Google [Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler) to run super fast. The JS source code will be editable and viewable (NYI). Using new awesome HTML5 APIs, you are able to access stuff such as image data from the webcam or have realtime communications between different computers via WebRTC.\r\n\r\n### Want something else?\r\nJust post an issue on Teach-OOP's GitHub repo ([here](https://github.com/mailmindlin/teach-oop/issues)), and I'll try to implement it. Note that by no standard is Teach-OOP finished; I have lots of [new features](https://github.com/mailmindlin/teach-oop/milestones) in the works. If you want to help code on this project, make a [pull request](https://github.com/mailmindlin/teach-oop/pulls).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@mailmindlin\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
