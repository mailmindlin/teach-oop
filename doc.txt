/*doc.txt
This document *should* document all of the other functions/paths/vars in the rest of the project. Note that this does NOT
include anything in /ScriptCam-master/, because I didn't write that.

blocks.js:
	[VAR]Blocks:
		This is the main block object.
		Constructor: blocks.js ->protoBlocks()
	[FN]protoBlocks():
		Constructor for Blocks.
		It returns an object with the following methods/variables:
			[VAR]registeredBlocks:
				All of the blocks that are registered. See [FN]registerNew
				Array
			[VAR]registeredTypes:
				All of the types that are registered. See [FN]registerType
				Array
			[VAR]metaTypes:
				TODO I don't remember what this does, but I think it's important.
				Array
			[FN]init:
				Initializes the object.
